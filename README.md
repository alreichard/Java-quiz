# Java-quiz
This cite is designed to quiz viewers on javascript questions. I designed it in order to learn more abuot java. This includes connecting HTML to javascript and using local storage. It also helped me improve my ability with using other parts of Javascript such as: loops, functions, css, etc. Quizzes like these help new users become more confident with their javascript knowledge, along with prepare them from technical interviews that are common in the computer science industry. 

Some features of this cite are:
- a 90 second timer to give a sense of urgency 
- a score board to track progress
